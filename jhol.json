Over the years, BMW’s lineup has expanded to include new models such as the X-line of SUVs, along with several electric and hybrid vehicles. When BMW decided to go racing during the 1970s and 1980s, the Motorsport division gave way to some of BMW’s most iconic performance models, particularly the M3 and M5. With race-derived engines hiding under the hoods of road cars, BMW M-cars have developed a cult following of their own that continues to this day. As BMW moves further into the 21st century, its vehicles are always at the forefront of technological advancements. While automobile design has evolved since BMW’s early days, the brand has remained true to its roots, making sure every new car retains the spirit of the Ultimate Driving Machine.\nBMW built its name around cars that delivered the excitement of driving a sports car, yet possessed the luxury and practicality of a traditional sedan, ultimately popularizing the sports sedan segment with its iconic 3-Series and 5-Series models.

Unlike a traditional car purchase, you don’t actually own the vehicle.\nUse this graph to compare average lease payments of comparable vehicles and find the right car for your budget.\nEach month there are varying incentives available for each vehicle and therefore the monthly payments can vary from month to month.\nLearn More\nA lease could be a great option for you but it depends on your circumstances and what is important to you. You should make sure you understand what your lease payments are paying for and the key rules that apply to leasing:\nYour lease payments are paying for:\nThe depreciation of the vehicle during the time you are leasing it.\nPaying for the interest (finance charge) that the leasing company charges you.\nIf you have chosen to add taxes and fees to the amount borrowed, paying for those.\nSome important rules to be aware of:\n1 You cannot drive more than the stated annual miles. If you do, there are excess mileage fees.\n2 You are liable for certain types of damage.\n3 There are costs that apply and procedures to follow at the end of you lease.\nClose\n2022\nMercedes-Benz\nGLC\nStarting MSRP\n$44,900\nStarting Lease\n$690 /mo\n2022\nAcura\nRDX\nStarting MSRP\n$41,145\nStarting Lease\n$555 /mo\n2022\nAudi\nQ5\nStarting MSRP\n$44,495\nStarting Lease\n$685 /mo\n2022\nVolvo\nXC40\nStarting MSRP\n$36,195\nStarting Lease\n$610 /mo\n2022\nAlfa Romeo\nStelvio\nStarting MSRP\n$47,145\nStarting Lease\n$618 /mo\n2022 BMW\nX3 Owner Ratings & Reviews\n3rd Generation BMW\nX3\n2018 - Present\nOverall Rating\n4.2\n8 out of 10\nBased on\n1,217 Ratings\nPerformance\n4.4\nComfort\n4.2\nFuel Efficiency\n3.8\nSafety Technology\n4.2\nFeatures\n4.2\n5 Star\n41 %\n4 Star\n42 %\n3 Star\n16 %\n2 Star\n1 %\n1 Star\n1 %\nAll Reviews\n5.0\n10 out of 10\nPerformance\n5.0\nComfort\n5.0\nFuel Efficiency\n5.0\nSafety Technology\n5.0\nFeatures\n5.0\n5.0\n10 out of 10\nPerformance\n5.0\nComfort\n5.0\nFuel Efficiency\n5.0\nSafety Technology\n5.0\nFeatures\n5.0\npros\nGood car overall\ncons\nCould have better MPG\nSubmitted by Abhishek\nG\non Feb 14, 2022 | 2022\nBMW\nX3\nxDrive30i AWD | Purchased on Jan 2022\n4.0\n8 out of 10\nPerformance\n3.0\nComfort\n4.0\nFuel Efficiency\n4.0\nSafety Technology\n1.0\nFeatures\n3.0\n4.0\n8 out of 10\npros\nSeat comfort, handling, and cargo capacity are all great.\ncons\ni-Drive is sub-par.
